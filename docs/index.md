# opticks: Systems Engineering Tool for Optical Systems

Notes and models on optics system engineering.

Check the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/egemenimre/opticks).

[Tutorials](tutorials.md) provide information on setting up basic tasks.See also [examples and how-to guides page](how_to_guides.md) for a few sample notebooks to carry out complex tasks.

The documentation for opticks is here: <https://opticks.readthedocs.io/>

## Requirements

- NumPy and SciPy are used for the underlying mathematical algorithms
- [Pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint) provides units and quantity support.
- [Prysm](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/) provides advanced optical design and analysis.
- [Strictyaml](https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml) provides YAML read/write support.
