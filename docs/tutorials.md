# Tutorials for Basic Tasks

Tutorials define how to carry out basic tasks in `optics`, as building blocks for more complex analysis.

- [Reading the config YAML files](tutorials/yaml_reader.ipynb): Reading the configuration files and extracting basic data
- [Defining an Aperture](tutorials/aperture.ipynb): Initialising a complex aperture.
- [Sampling Factors and PSF Plane Scaling](tutorials/psf_scaling.ipynb): How to set up sampling factors, particularly when focussing from Pupil to PSF Plane. Scaling for advanced PSF Analysis.
